Overview
This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. Fraudulent transactions in credit card data can cause significant financial losses to both customers and businesses. Therefore, accurate detection of fraudulent activities is crucial for maintaining the security and integrity of the financial system.


Approach
We employ machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model capable of identifying fraudulent transactions. The steps involved in the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and scaling features as necessary.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding the distribution of data, identifying patterns, and exploring relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Selection: Trying out different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting, and selecting the best-performing model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the selected model using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model parameters to optimize performance further.
Deployment: Deploying the trained model in a production environment for real-time fraud detection.
